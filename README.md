## How It Started
When I had concerns over the many blind intersections in my small, wooded, and hilly town, I proposed building an advance-warning system to improve the safety of blind intersections. I petitioned my mayor on the issue and to consider my proposed solution.

What started as a personal engineering project has morphed into a full-time undertaking: now, I’m working on this project with a team for my EDD (Engineering Design & Development) class in school. Our functional prototype is complete and is currently undergoing testing.

## How It Works
